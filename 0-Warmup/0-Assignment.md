I want to gain comfort using the Linux operating system and understand how programs are run safely by memory allocation and management.

I am new to programming, have never used 'make', and have only minor git and Linux experience so I have a lot to catch up on. I plan to meet with the instructors as noted in the syllabus and will be seeking out additional resources to get around this.
